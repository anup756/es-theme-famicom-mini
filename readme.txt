Changed folder colors to match selector bar color as they were black on a black background.  Edited the font to replace the @ symbol with a folder icon, now if you name you folders with an @ followed by a space and then the folder name it will display a little folder icon on the game list. eg instead of a folder named 'Puzzle' you would name the folder '@ Puzzle'.

11/03/2017 
Updated gamelist font so that the folder icon now replaces the # symbol.  This means if you name your folder for example "# Puzzle" it will be shown with a folder icon and all folders will appear at the top of the list when sorted alphabetically.
