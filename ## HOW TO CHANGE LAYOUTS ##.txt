How to change the layout and style in the Famicom Mini theme.

You are now able to switch between two different styles Famicom and NES. 
 
You are now able to choose from several different pre-defined layouts.  Please see the png file that is included titled ## LAYOUT GUIDE ##.png for all of the available options.


To Change the style, find the following line:

	<include>./style/famicom/style.xml</include>

Change the word 'famicom' to 'nes' to change to the nes style (vice versa to change back to the famicom style).



To change the layout open the layout.xml file.

Find the following line:

	<include>./layouts/a.xml</include>
	
Change the letter 'a' to the letter corresponding the the layout of your choice (see ## LAYOUT GUIDE ##.png) and save the file.  When you restart Emulation Station the new layout will be active.
